# Mimosas Bartender Database
This application was built for a local restaurant here in Denver. The idea is for every bartender to have a single source for drink recipes (so as to stay consistent), and more importantly, having the same pour for every drink.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch API

This application was created using flexbox, in order to make the site responsive on all screen sizes. Because the app is intended to be used by bartenders while working, it was conceived with a "mobile first" design. JavaScript is used to make a fetch to the api to retrieve the data. The app is extremely lightweight to ensure it will work in busy environments where wifi and cell service may be spotty.

## Optimizations

After initial delivery, it was requested that I make the main button much larger. This is to facilitate a bartender being able to use the app with one hand while shaking a drink in the other.  

## Lessons Learned:

It was very informative to have client feedback on this project. I had made particular design decisions in order to achieve a certain look. However, the feedback made me realize that application functionality would be much more important in practice, and my client was much happier having something lightweight that conformed to their specifications.
